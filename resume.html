        <p>Heart disease alternatively known as cardiovascular disease, encases various conditions that impact  the heart and is the primary basis of death worldwide over the span of the past few decades.It associates many risk factors in heart disease and a need of the time to getaccurate, reliable, and sensible approaches to make an early diagnosis to achieve prompt management of the disease. Data mining is a commonly used technique for processing enormous data in the healthcare domain. Researchers apply several data mining and machine learning techniques to huge complex medical data, helping healthcare professionals to predict heart disease.This research paper presents various attributes related to heart disease, and the model on basis of supervised learning algorithms as Naïve Bayes, decision tree, K- nearest neighbor, and random forest algorithm</p>

        <p>Cryptocurrency is the peer-to-peer digital moneyory and payment system that exist online via a controlled algorithem. When a miner cracks an algorithem to record a block of transactions to public ledger named blockchain and the cryptocurrency is created when the block is added to the blockchain. It allows people to store and transfer through encryption protocol and distributed network. Mining is a necessary and competitive component of the cryptocurrency system. The miner with more computational power has a better chance of finding a new coin than that of less</p>
